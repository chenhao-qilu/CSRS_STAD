**Clinical Features and Molecular Landscape of Cuproptosis Signature Related Molecular Subtype in Gastric Cancer**

Recent studies have highlighted the biological significance of cuproptosis in disease occurrence and development. However, it remains unclear whether cuproptosis signaling also has potential impact in the tumour initiation and prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). In this study, 16 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) transcriptional profile were harnessed to perform the regularized latent variable model-based clustering in GC. A cuproptosis signature risk scoring (CSRS) scheme, which based on weighted sum of principle components of the CRGs, was used to evaluate the prognosis and risk of individual tumors of GC.
